# This function get a reads file and put into a dataframe.
# 
# The files are usually stored in a .gz file. If the .gz file has been unzip
# before the function won't try to unzip it, it will read the .fastq instead.
# If the file is a .gz, and there is no .fastq in the same folder with the same
# name, the function will unzip the .gz file and leave the .fastq in the same
# folder.
#
# Prerrequisites:
#
#   The file must exist, and you must have reads rights.
#
#   If the file is zipped, you must have write rights.
#
# The function takes the following parameters:
#   
#   fileName: (String) A String with the absolute path to the file.
# 
# The function returns:
#
#   If there is no errors:
#   (Dataframe) A dataframe with the following columns:
# 
#       [01] Sequence line
#       [02] Quality
#  
#   If the FASTQ file has a number of files that is not divisible by 4:
#   NULL
# 
# Invariant:
#   
#   The unzipped file contain a plain text file. This file is formatted with a
#   FASTQ format, meaning that is repeating the following pattern over an over
#   again:
#   - Line with the ID and other metadata
#   - Line with the sequence
#   - '+ line'
#   - Line with the quality of the nucleotides
# 
#   This means that the number of lines in that file must be divisible by 4.
# 
#   Worth mentioning that this function is suppose to be use for the forward
#   and reverse reads. The number of lines in each of those FASTQ files must
#   be the same.
