# This script compare the running time of the sequence aligning algorithm that
# are in:
# Biostring in R
# Our developed Gotoh in C++
#
# The algorithm generate a random sequence of N size; called sequence "A"
# Then it modifies the sequence randomly. The new sequence is of size <= N
# and have a total of MUTATION_RATIO % changes from the original.

# For our developed version, we are using the function that allocate memory for
# two sequences only; not the one that allocate for a lot of sequences only one
# time. Since allocation is time expensive, the other version will be faster
# than the result of this test.

# The results is a graphic where the X-axis represent the sequence size and the
# Y-axis represent the time taken to accomplish that alignment.

# Be aware that the first sequence will be an outliner. R will take time to
# compile the c++ code and initialize whatever internal datastructures is using
